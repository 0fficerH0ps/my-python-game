You will need Pygame to play the game.

To install Pygame, enter the following command  at a terminal prompt:
$ python -m pip install --user pygame

This command tells python to run the pip module and install the pygame package to the current user's Python installation. If you use a command other than python to run programs or start ata terminal session, such as python3, your command will look like this:
$python3 -m pip install --user pygame

If the command doesn't work on macOS, try running the command again without the --user flag.
